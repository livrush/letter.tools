const instructions = `{{salutation}}

Welcome to letter.tools! This site is dedicated to simplifying writing multiple letters with similar, but varying, content.

All you need to do is write up the letter you want, and set anything you want to be injected you should wrap in double curly braces, like this: {{variable}}

Once you set your variables they should show up in the left side column, and you can use the accompanying inputs to specify the value of each variable.

{{regards}}`;

export { instructions };
